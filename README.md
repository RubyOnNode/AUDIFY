# AUDIFY
Problem Statement
Churning in the mobile application industry is one of the major challenges. We say a customer is
churned when he or she has stopped using the services or buying the products of a firm, in our case
a customer is churned when the user uninstalls the Audify application.

We need to do the analysis of the data that was collected from Firebase - Google Analytics. Find out
the behavior of the users who are uninstalling the app. What factors or features are affecting the
churning behavior of the users and how likely ( probability ) users are going to uninstall the app who
have not yet uninstalled.
